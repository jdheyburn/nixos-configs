# nixos-configs

A place for me to dump nix configs

## Deployment

[deploy-rs](https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs) is used to deploy the configurations.

```bash
# all hosts
nix run github:serokell/deploy-rs -- -s "."

# per host
nix run github:serokell/deploy-rs -- -s ".#dee"

# more explicit parameters
nix run github:serokell/deploy-rs -- --keep-result --auto-rollback false --magic-rollback false --activation-timeout 3600 -s ".#dee"
```

## Catalog

`catalog.nix` is a global state file of sorts. The idea is that anything that is shared across nodes is defined here so that they can build their respective configs.

### Services

Services is a mapping of service name to service attributes, it can accept:

- `host`
  - The node that runs this service
- `port`
  - Port this service runs on
- `modules`
  - A list of strings containing the modules to check on the desired host to see if its enabled
    - e.g. `[ "prometheusStack" "prometheusStack.grafana" ]`
    - Downstream dependencies resolve to true if both `modules.prometheusStack.enable` and `modules.prometheusStack.grafana.enable` are true
  - Used to determine whether:
    - DNS rewrite entry is created on the DNS server
    - Blackbox exporter should perform healthchecks against it
- `dashy.section`
  - What section in dashy it should fall under
- `dashy.description`
  - The description to use in dashy
- `dashy.icon`
  - The icon to display in dashy
- `blackbox.name`
  - Whether the service name in healthchecks differs from the DNS name
- `blackbox.path`
  - The path that blackbox healthchecks should use, if it differs from root `/`

## Hosts

- dee
  - Raspberry Pi 4 4GB
  - Replaced dee_rpi3
- dennis
  - VM on a Proxmox hypervisor
- macbook
  - MBP with nix-darwin

Hosts are defined in `nodes`, which can have these attributes:

- `ip.private`
  - Private IP address
- `ip.tailscale`
  - IP address as tailscale sees it
- `system`
  - What system architecture is this host
  - Also used to determine if it is a nixOS or darwin (macOS) machine
- `nixosHardware`
  - Any [nixos-hardware](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware) flakes that should be included on this host
- `shouldScrape`
  - If Prometheus should scrape this node for metrics
  - This is only temporary while I decom the non-NixOS hosts (TODO)
- `users`
  - list of users that should have home-manager configurations enabled for

## Runbooks

### Upgrading to latest versions

1. Update nix flake

    ```bash
    nix flake upgrade
    ```

2. Update overlays
    - [healthchecks](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/servers/web-apps/healthchecks/default.nix)
    - [plex](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/servers/plex)

3. Update container images
    - [dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/releases)

### Adding secrets

Secrets are managed by [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix).

1. Ensure the host or user you're on has it's public key added to `secrets/secrets.nix`, look in `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`.

2. cd to `secrets`

3. Execute `nix run github:ryantm/agenix -- -e FILENAME.age`

4. Add the file to git so that flakes can see it

5. Reference the secret where you need it, i.e.:

```nix
age.secrets."healthchecks-secrets-file" = {
  file = ../../secrets/healthchecks-secrets-file.age;
  owner = "healthchecks";
  group = "healthchecks";
};

mySecretFile = config.age.secrets."healthchecks-secrets-file".path;
```

### Setting null sha256

Explicitly setting the sha256 attribute to an empty string will have Nix assume no validation.

It will then error on a hash mismatch, so copy the actual hash and paste it in the empty string.

```nix
sha256 = "";
```

## Tips

- [Go here](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-is-the-latest-best-practice-to-prefetch-the-hash/22103/4) for how blank hashes are structured
- If after updating there are complaints about options no longer present, it's likely that they are no longer available, so they need to be removed
- You can use `nixos-option` to find what options are available, and their specification

## TODO

- Better file structure, look to flake-parts for this
  - i.e.:
    - generic Nix settings across all systems
    - generic NixOS
    - generic nix-darwin
    - host-level configs
    - generic home-manager
    - generic Linux home-manager
    - generic macOS home-manager
